- [ ] Verify deployment: Check Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/health`

### 3. Deploy Frontend
- [ ] Deploy Pages: `npx wrangler pages deploy pages/dist --project-name cf-ai-supportbot-frontend`
- [ ] Verify Pages deployment: Check Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Test frontend: Visit Pages URL

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run verification script: `./scripts/verify-deployment.sh production --detailed`
- [ ] Monitor deployment: `./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh production 15`
- [ ] Test API endpoints manually
- [ ] Test WebSocket connectivity
- [ ] Verify tool integrations
