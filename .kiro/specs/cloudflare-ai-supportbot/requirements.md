# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive AI-powered support bot system built on Cloudflare's infrastructure. The system leverages Llama 3.3 70B model via Workers AI, uses Cloudflare Workflows for orchestration, Durable Objects for session management, and Pages with Realtime for the frontend. The bot provides intelligent customer support with memory, tool integration, and real-time chat capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to interact with an AI support bot through a real-time chat interface, so that I can get immediate assistance with my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the chat interface THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time communication
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL process it through the Llama 3.3 model and return a response within 5 seconds
3. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL initialize a unique session ID and create a Durable Object instance
4. IF the WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the AI bot to remember our conversation context, so that I don't have to repeat information during our chat session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL create a session-scoped memory store in a Durable Object
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history and generate periodic summaries
3. WHEN a session exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL compress older messages into summaries while preserving recent context
4. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL archive the conversation to R2 storage for future reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the AI bot to perform actions like searching knowledge base or creating tickets, so that it can provide comprehensive support beyond just answering questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI determines a knowledge base search is needed THEN the system SHALL execute the "kb.search" tool with appropriate parameters
2. WHEN a customer issue requires escalation THEN the system SHALL use the "create_ticket" tool to generate a support ticket
3. WHEN a customer asks about ticket status THEN the system SHALL use the "fetch_status" tool to retrieve current information
4. IF a tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to handle long-running processes reliably, so that complex operations don't fail due to timeouts or temporary issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complex operation is initiated THEN the system SHALL use Cloudflare Workflows for orchestration
2. WHEN a workflow step fails THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry mechanisms with idempotency keys
3. WHEN workflows require compensation THEN the system SHALL execute rollback steps to maintain data consistency
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL update the session state with results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to interact with the bot using voice input, so that I can have a more natural conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is enabled THEN the system SHALL capture audio through WebRTC
2. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using STT integration
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL optionally convert text responses to speech using TTS
4. IF voice features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to text-only mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and rate limiting, so that the system operates reliably and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce token and rate limits per session
2. WHEN PII is detected in messages THEN the system SHALL filter or redact sensitive information
3. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log with request IDs and latency metrics
4. WHEN failures happen THEN the system SHALL track failure rates and implement circuit breakers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete project structure with documentation, so that I can easily deploy and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
2. WHEN AI prompts are used THEN the system SHALL document them in PROMPTS.md
3. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated deployment scripts
4. WHEN testing is required THEN the system SHALL include unit tests and load testing capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to demonstrate Cloudflare's edge computing advantages, so that the architecture showcases platform-specific benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL leverage edge compute for low latency responses
2. WHEN state management is needed THEN the system SHALL use Durable Objects for consistent, low-latency state
3. WHEN long-running processes execute THEN the system SHALL use Workflows for guaranteed execution
4. WHEN the system scales THEN it SHALL demonstrate cost-effective scaling through Cloudflare's pricing model
